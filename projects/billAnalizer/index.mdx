### Introduction
The "XML Invoice Analyzer" is a Node.js console application designed to analyze XML files generated by the DIAN (Colombian tax authority). Its main purpose is to generate comprehensive sales statistics from electronic invoices stored in a specific folder.

### Project Purpose and Goal
The project aims to assist businesses in obtaining valuable insights into their product sales. By processing the XML files, the application calculates the total units sold and revenue generated for each product. This data enables informed decision-making based on accurate sales statistics.

### Web Stack and Explanation
The application is built using Node.js, and it leverages the "fs" (file system) and "xml2js" libraries for file handling and XML parsing, respectively. It reads XML files from a designated folder and extracts relevant information such as invoice IDs, buyer details, and itemized sales data. The data is then aggregated and summarized to provide comprehensive sales statistics.

### Problems and Thought Process
During development, challenges arose in locating specific XML tags and efficiently traversing nested structures. The thought process involved identifying the required information and mapping the XML tag paths accordingly. Additionally, handling complex arrays and implementing data aggregation methods were key considerations in achieving the desired results.

### Lessons Learned
One important lesson learned from this project was how to effectively work with complex array structures and perform calculations based on the extracted data. Additionally, the project provided valuable insights into handling XML parsing and file processing in a Node.js environment.
